My journey of studying computer science started nearly two decaeds ago when I first used a personal computer to play games. Just like anyone else around me, I wanted to create a fun game of my own, and decided to learn how to write a program. I first learned QBasic, and it was fun to write a program that prints out a bunch of characters on an old CRT monitor. At the time playing games was more fun to me than writing programs -- partly because I was not as motivated -- and I was more interested in studying for math olympiads than programming.

Then, in year 2000, I randomly stumbled upon a programming contest by a recommendation from my middle school teacher -- not because I knew how to write a program, but because I was good at using some of the PC tools for homework. I thought it would be fun to participate, so I did. It turned out that I was taking a written exam on basic programming questions, such as ``what will be the output of the following program?'' I was given thirty multiple-choice questions, and I was not able to answer any of them with confidence  -- after all, I knew nothing about programming.




After all, I think I was lucky enough to find the right resources at the right time.  I have enjoyed studying computer science, learning how research is done at top universities, and solving problems that are exciting to me.
