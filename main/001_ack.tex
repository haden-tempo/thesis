It has been quite a journey, with ups and downs.
In one word, it was just really fun -- it was fun to think about problems, talk about problems, and write about problems. 

It has been quite a journey, and I am glad to put a proper end to it. 
I learned a lot, and I enjoyed it a lot more. 
Lots of memories are afloat in my head, which I will preish. 


To the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation, for supporting my graduate studies.

To my advisors, Yoav Shoham, Virginia Williams, and Ashish Goel, for their guidance and support.

To my colleagues, for fun and inspiring discussions, whether academic or not -- Albert No, Ernest Ryu, Minyong Lee, Sean Choi, Jaehwan Kang, and Eric Huang.

To Bobby Kleinberg and Johannes Gehrke, for having me as a research assistant at Cornell University -- working with you convinced me to pursue a doctoral degree.

To my Anand Bhaskar and SueYeon Chung, for motivating me to consider a doctoral degree in the first place.

To my parents, J and M, for their love and support.

To my daughter, Maya, for making my journey more exciting -- truly blessing.

Last but never the least, to my wife, Alice, for unconditional support and love.

I thank all of you for making my journey a special and memorable one, and I surely enjoyed my ride.
