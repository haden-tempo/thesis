My journey of studying computer science started nearly two decaeds ago when I first used a personal computer to play games. Just like anyone else around me, I wanted to create a fun game of my own, and decided to learn how to write a program. I first learned QuickBasic 



My journey of studying computer science began when I was about 10.
Just like any other kids, I was into computer games, and of course I wanted to create my own. 
I started learning how to program in Quick Basic, which allowed me to draw circls or squares in colors on a CRT monitor.
At the time playing games was more fun than writing programs -- partly because I was not as motivated, yet I was into math olympiads and competitions.




After all, I think I was lucky enough to find the right resources at the right time.  I have enjoyed studying computer science, learning how research is done at top universities, and solving problems that are exciting to me.
