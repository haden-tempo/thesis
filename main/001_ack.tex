It has been quite a journey, with ups and downs.
In one word, it was just really {\em fun} -- it was fun to think about, talk about, and write about the problems that I worked on. 
Now that I am putting a proper end to this journey, lots of thanks are due. 

To the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation and its staffs, for supporting my graduate studies financially -- it helped me concentrate on my research.

To my advisors, Yoav Shoham, Virginia Williams, and Ashish Goel, for their guidance and support. From Yoav, more than anything, I learned how to be proactive. He once told me to ``ask for forgiveness'' rather than to ``ask for permission.'' 


To my colleagues, for fun and inspiring discussions, whether academic or not -- Albert No, Ernest Ryu, Minyong Lee, Sean Choi, Jaehwan Kang, and Eric Huang.

To Bobby Kleinberg and Johannes Gehrke, for having me as a research assistant at Cornell University -- working with you convinced me to pursue a doctoral degree.

To my Anand Bhaskar and SueYeon Chung, for motivating me to consider a doctoral degree in the first place.

To my parents, J and M, for their love and support.

To my daughter, Maya, for making my journey more exciting -- truly blessing.

Last but never the least, to my wife, Alice, for unconditional support and love.

I thank all of you for making my journey a special and memorable one, and I surely enjoyed my ride.
