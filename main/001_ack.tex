It has been quite a journey, with ups and downs.
In one word, it was just really {\em fun} -- it was fun to think about, talk about, and write about the problems that I worked on. 
Now that I am putting a proper end to this journey, lots of thanks are due. 

To the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation and its staffs, for supporting my graduate studies financially -- it helped me concentrate on my research.

To my advisors, Yoav Shoham, Virginia Williams, and Ashish Goel, for their guidance and support. From Yoav, more than anything, I learned how to be proactive -- ``ask for forgiveness, not permission'' is the saying that has changed my perspectives and habits. I thank Virginia and Ashish, who are officially my co-advisors, for agreeing to advise me after Yoav had decided to retire. Thanks to their advice and support, I was able to overcome what seemed to be the end of the road at the time. I had a few ideas about a few problems, but my ideas did not pan out exactly the way I wanted, and I was not sure which direction I should pursue. With Ashish, I focused more on application-driven problems with practical use in mind, and with Virginia, I dove into a deeper level of computational complexity than what I knew about it before I met her. As Yoav predicted, I got to experience the best of both worlds, and I really enjoyed it. So, again, I thank all three of my advisors for sharing their wisdom and guiding me through this journey.

To June Lee, Junghwa Bae, Yoonho Kim, Jangryul Yoon, Minjung Kim, Jaehyun Bae, Brian Lee, Heeyoon Lee, Sean Choi, Jihoon Jang, Albert No, Ernest Ryu, and Minyong Lee -- Thanks a lot for great memories and fun times at Stanford. 

I really enjoyed our round-robin pop-up seminars during which one of us presented whatever we were working on or would be helpful to all. I initiated organizing it because every time when we gathered at someone's place with [lots of] beers, we ended up discussing somewhat math-y and fun problems or brain-teasers -- so, how about we meet once a week and talk about them when we are sober? At first I was not sure if it would actually last for long, but we have done it for four years now! I learned a lot from you guys, and I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end. 

To June Lee, Junghwa Bae, Yoonho Kim, Jangryul Yoon, Minjung Kim, Jaehyun Bae, 

To Brian Lee, Heeyoon Lee, Haechang Lee, June Lee, Junghwa Bae, Yoonho Kim, Jangryul Yoon, Minjung Kim, Sean Choi, Jaehwan Kang, Jihoon Jang, Fiona Lee,  -- You guys made my time at Stanford extra special  


To Bobby Kleinberg and Johannes Gehrke, for having me as a research assistant at Cornell University -- working with you convinced me to pursue a doctoral degree.

To my Anand Bhaskar and SueYeon Chung, for motivating me to consider a doctoral degree in the first place.

To my parents, J and M, for their love and support.

To my daughter, Maya, for making my journey more exciting -- truly blessing.

Last but never the least, to my wife, Alice, for unconditional support and love.

I thank all of you for making my journey a special and memorable one, and I surely enjoyed my ride.
