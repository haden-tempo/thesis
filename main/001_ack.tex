It has been quite a journey, with ups and downs.
In one word, it was just really {\em fun} -- it was fun to think about, talk about, and write about the problems that I worked on. 
Now that I am putting a proper end to this journey, lots of thanks are due. 

To the Kwanjeong Educational Foundation and its staffs, for supporting my graduate studies financially -- it helped me concentrate on my research.

To my advisors, Yoav Shoham, Virginia Williams, and Ashish Goel, for their guidance and support. From Yoav, more than anything, I learned how to be proactive -- ``ask for forgiveness, not permission'' is the saying that has changed my perspectives and habits. I thank Virginia and Ashish, who are officially my co-advisors, for agreeing to advise me after Yoav had decided to retire. Thanks to their advice and support, I was able to overcome what seemed to be the end of the road at the time. I had a few ideas about a few problems, but my ideas did not pan out exactly the way I wanted, and I was not sure which direction I should pursue. With Ashish, I focused more on application-driven problems with practical use in mind, and with Virginia, I dove into a deeper level of computational complexity than what I knew about it before I met her. As Yoav predicted, I got to experience the best of both worlds, and I really enjoyed it. So, again, I thank all three of my advisors for sharing their wisdom and guiding me through this journey.

To June Lee, Junghwa Bae, Yoonho Kim, Jangryul Yoon, Minjung Kim, Jaehyun Bae, Brian Lee, Heeyoon Lee, Sean Choi, Jihoon Jang, Albert No, Ernest Ryu, and Minyong Lee -- Thanks a lot for great memories and fun times at Stanford. 
Special thanks to Albert, Ernest, and Minyong for agreeing to be a part of my pop-up seminar series, which I thought of at Minyong's studio when we were having trouble talking about math-y stuff after having too many beers. When we were sober, we talked like professionals, and I really enjoyed it. 

To Adrian Marple, Jacob Bank, and Eric Huang -- it was really fun to work with you guys. Hope to the all-you-can-east-sushi place one more time.


To Bobby Kleinberg and Johannes Gehrke, for having me as a research assistant at Cornell University -- working with you convinced me to pursue a doctoral degree, and I have no regret about it. Serendipity is the word I would use -- it never occurred to me that I would pursue a doctoral degree (I was not even sure what a doctoral degree exactly meant at the time), but I realized that it was something I would love doing, all thanks to you. 

To my Anand Bhaskar and SueYeon Chung, for motivating me to consider a doctoral degree in the first place. I will never forget the time when we stayed up all night at the Upson Hall Computer Lab when we participated in the Mathematical Contest of Modeling -- I learned a lot from you, and I really enjoyed doing great things together with you. 

To my parents, JL and MM, for their tremendous love and support. My ride began when my father let me learn programming 



To my daughter, Maya, for making my journey more exciting -- truly blessing.

Last but never the least, to my wife, Alice, for unconditional support and love.

I thank all of you for making my journey a special and memorable one, and I surely enjoyed my ride.
