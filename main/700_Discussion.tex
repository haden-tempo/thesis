In Chapter~\ref{bdoodle:chapter}, we modeled group scheduling problems as an optimization problem by considering time and inconvenience as two important meausres of efficiency of the scheduling processes. We prsented an efficient algorithm that can find an optimal partition of date/time options into batches, which can substantially improve the overall efficiency of the scheduling process compared to Doodle, under various cost functions. In particular, when agents are relatively less busy, the number of agents is small, and the number of options is large, our proposed Batched Doodle approach can shine. It will be an interesting experiment if this can be applied to certain settings to see if our theoretical model can
