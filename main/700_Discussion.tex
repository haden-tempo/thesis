\label{discussion:chapter}

In Chapter~\ref{bdoodle:chapter}, we modeled group scheduling problems as an optimization problem by considering time and inconvenience as two important meausres of efficiency of the scheduling processes. We prsented an efficient algorithm that can find an optimal partition of date/time options into batches, which can substantially improve the overall efficiency of the scheduling process compared to Doodle, under various cost functions.
