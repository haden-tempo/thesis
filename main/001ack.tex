My journey of studying computer science started nearly two decaeds ago.



My journey of studying computer science began when I was about 10.
Just like any other kids, I was into computer games, and of course I wanted to create my own. 
I started learning how to program in Quick Basic, which allowed me to draw circls or squares in colors on a CRT monitor.
At the time playing games was more fun than writing programs -- partly because I was not as motivated, yet I was into math olympiads and competitions.
