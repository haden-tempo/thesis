This dissertation is a result of support from my advisors, family, friends and colleagues. 

I was truly fortunate to have worked with three different advisors -- Yoav Shoham, Ashish Goel, and Virginia Williams.
I had many chances to observe and learn how the best teachers and researchers in the field think and act.
I thank all my three advisors for their support and advice -- my five years at Stanford couldn't have been better!

I also thank my family for unconditional support.
